# Create a game with a 2-dimensional map.
# Place the player, a door, and a monster into random spots in your map.
# Let the player move around in the map and, after each move,
# tell them if they've found the door or the monster.
# If they find either the game is over.
# The door is the win condition, the monster is the lose condition.
