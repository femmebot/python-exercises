# The dictionary will be something like:
# {'Jason Seifer': ['Ruby Foundations', 'Ruby on Rails Forms', 'Technology Foundations'],
#  'Kenneth Love': ['Python Basics', 'Python Collections']}

# Update it when you find a teacher with more classes than
# the current count. Better hold onto the teacher name somewhere
# too!
